# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
1. Methods are great. I understand the basics of how to use them, but have a lot to learn to get fluent in them.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
1. I feel very confident with the basics of creating new methods.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
1. I would like to know why the return value of built-in string modifiers like squeeze is a new string, while the return value of a method I create myself that creates a string is nil.
